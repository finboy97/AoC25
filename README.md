# AoC25

#### day 1
- Dreadful; I didn't remember wraparound indexing and tried vscode copilot for the first time - feel 10 iq worse off for having my errors shown by a bot. Still, had the right idea I suppose, but not the final execution.

#### day 2
- Much better - copilot firmly turned off. Definitely could be neater but it shows the steps I took thinking it through. Looking up later, I learned that instead of the concat string code I did, you can just do concatenated_string = string * repetitions. 

#### day 3
- Part 1 ok. Finding largest 2 digit combo in order was ok. Part 2 no - method I used without thinking hard used way too much memory. I looked up an answer but don't want to use it because it's not my own. Will need to return to this later.
